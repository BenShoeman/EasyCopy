# EasyCopy

EasyCopy takes information from collection guide lists and copies an Excel-friendly version of them to the clipboard. The goal is to mostly automate data entry with minimal need for the user to intervene.

## Building

You can either run easycopy.py in Python 3, or run `make` to create an executable (which requires pyinstaller). Only tested on Windows 10, but should work for most OSes.
